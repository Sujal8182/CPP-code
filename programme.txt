1. what is programming ?
Ans. programming is set of instructions of any specific event or task with each step to solution to the code.

2. what is a translator in programming?
Ans.  Translator in programming which coverts the code into computer language as a binary code because the coding language is human language and binary is understanding of computer language.

3. Types of translators in C and C++ ?
Ans. There are two types of translator .  1. Interpreter 2. Compiler
        1. Interpreter is a translator which translates the whole code one by one and line by line.
        2. Compiler translator converts the whole code in a one file as whole.        

4. Diff btw compiler and interpreter?
Ans.  1. Compiler translates the whole code directly into binary and instead the interpreter translates the code one by one
      2. C++ is compiler language but python is interpreter language
      3. interpreter language is more preferable because of it specific line reading and compiler reads the whole data.
